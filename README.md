# <p style="text-align: center;">Rake Moded</p>

I do not assume ownership of the original player and this is not an official repository.

This repository contains files of the modified version of the 2015 Rake game. I'm doing this in order to refine the game since the author of Konsordo stopped supporting it and left a lot of bugs and flaws.

At the beginning of the journey, I will use **Melon Loader** to upgrade the game. But in the future, if the project is more popular, I will transfer it to a full-fledged unity project.

## What does this mod add?
- Asset Bundle Loader
- At the moment it is a resource loader (To modify the game's resources)
- UI Manager (Makes it easier to create a graphical interface)

## How to try the mod?

- Install Melon Loader 5.7 x86
- Download the mod
- Transfer the contents to the game folder (*Rake Multiplayer*)
